/// Executes a coroutine (future) in a Tokio runtime context.
///
/// This function is useful for executing async code in contexts where you need to get a
/// block on a coroutine but want to maintain the current runtime context. It's particularly
/// helpful when integrating async code with synchronous interfaces.
///
/// This function works in two modes:
/// 1. If called from within a Tokio runtime context, it uses the current runtime
/// 2. If called from outside a runtime (e.g., worker threads), it uses a global runtime
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `coroutine` - The future to execute
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns the result of the coroutine execution.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use rpc_client::utils::execute_coroutine;
///
/// fn main() {
///     // Execute an async operation in a blocking context
///     let result = execute_coroutine(async {
///         // Some async operation
///         tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
///         42
///     });
///
///     assert_eq!(result, 42);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Note
///
/// This function will create a global multi-threaded Tokio runtime on first use
/// if called outside a runtime context. This makes it safe to use from any thread,
/// including worker threads spawned by external libraries.
