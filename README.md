## ðŸ“– About

The [Starknet OS](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/os.cairo) is a [Cairo program](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) responsible for proving the integrity of the computation required to transition from the state of a previous block to the state of the next block.

It accomplishes this by re-executing the transactions included in the block and verifying the consistency of the Starknet state.

Executing this program yields a PIE (Program Independent Execution), which can later be used to generate a Stark proof of execution integrity.

If this proof is accepted by the Starknet L1 verifiers, the block is considered valid, and the Starknet state root is updated in the [StarknetCore contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc662c410c0ecf747543f5ba90660f6abebd9c8c4#code).
